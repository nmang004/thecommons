## 📝 Implementation Notes

### Key Decisions Made
- ✅ Used Auth0 Universal Login for consistent UX across all devices
- ✅ Implemented custom database connection for seamless user migration  
- ✅ Maintained existing role system (author, editor, reviewer, admin)
- ✅ Preserved all user profile data and permissions during migration
- ✅ Used Auth0 Actions for token enrichment instead of Rules (deprecated)

### Lessons Learned
- ✅ Auth0 Actions are more reliable than Rules for custom logic
- ✅ Custom database connection simplified user migration significantly
- ✅ Token refresh handling requires careful configuration in Next.js
- ✅ Auth0 metadata structure should be planned early to avoid restructuring

### Technical Debt
- ✅ No significant technical debt incurred
- ✅ Clean migration with proper fallbacks implemented
- ✅ All deprecated Supabase auth code properly removed

## 🚨 Rollback Plan

### Rollback Triggers
- Critical authentication failures
- Data loss or corruption
- Performance degradation > 50%
- Security vulnerabilities discovered

### Rollback Procedure
1. Revert environment variables to Supabase configuration
2. Deploy previous application version
3. Restore database if schema changes were made
4. Communicate rollback to users
5. Post-mortem analysis and planning
