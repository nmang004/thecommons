# Review Quality Assurance System

## Overview

The Review Quality Assurance System is a comprehensive AI-powered solution for monitoring, analyzing, and improving the quality of peer reviews in academic publishing. It provides real-time assistance to reviewers, automated quality analysis, and powerful analytics tools for editors and administrators.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Quality Analysis Engine** (`/lib/services/quality-analysis.ts`)
   - AI-powered review analysis using OpenAI GPT-4
   - Automated metrics calculation (completeness, timeliness, depth)
   - Bias detection and consistency checking
   - Quality scoring and recommendations

2. **Background Job Processing** (`/lib/services/quality-job-processor.ts`)
   - Asynchronous analysis pipeline
   - Redis-based job queue
   - Retry mechanisms and error handling
   - Consistency analysis across multiple reviewers

3. **Notification System** (`/lib/services/quality-notifications.ts`)
   - Real-time alerts for quality issues
   - Weekly summaries for editors
   - Training assignment notifications
   - Push notification support

4. **Real-time Assistance** (`/components/reviews/ReviewAssistant.tsx`)
   - Live feedback as reviewers type
   - Bias detection and warnings
   - Completeness checking
   - Tone and clarity suggestions

5. **Analytics Dashboard** (`/components/dashboard/quality/`)
   - Quality trends visualization

### Request/Response Examples

#### Quality Report
```json
{
  "report_id": "uuid",
  "quality_score": 0.85,
  "status": "analysis_complete",
  "metrics": {
    "automated": {
      "completeness": 0.95,
      "timeliness": 0.80,
      "depth": 0.87
    },
    "nlp": {
      "constructiveness_score": 0.78,
      "clarity": 0.82,
      "professionalism": 0.90
    }
  },
  "flags": ["excellent_quality"],
  "recommendations": [...]
}
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# OpenAI API (required for AI analysis)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key

# Redis (required for job queue)
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379
REDIS_PASSWORD=your_redis_password

# Supabase (required for database)
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### Quality Metrics Configuration

Default quality metrics can be configured in the `quality_metrics_config` table:

```sql
-- Example: Adjust constructiveness threshold
UPDATE quality_metrics_config 
SET excellent_threshold = 0.90,
    good_threshold = 0.75,
    acceptable_threshold = 0.60
WHERE metric_name = 'constructiveness_score';
```

## Deployment

### Database Migration

Run the quality system migration:

```bash
# Apply the quality system tables and functions
psql -f lib/supabase/migrations/20250110_review_quality_system.sql
```

### Background Jobs

Start the quality job processor:

```typescript
import { QualityJobProcessor } from '@/lib/services/quality-job-processor';

const processor = new QualityJobProcessor();
processor.start();
```

### Scheduled Tasks

Set up cron jobs for maintenance:

```bash
# Daily maintenance (reminders, cleanup)
0 2 * * * curl -X POST /api/quality/trigger -d '{"action": "daily_maintenance"}'

# Weekly summaries (Monday 9 AM)
0 9 * * 1 curl -X POST /api/quality/trigger -d '{"action": "weekly_summary"}'
```

## Integration

### Webhook Integration

Trigger quality analysis on review events:

```typescript
// On review submission
await QualityTriggers.onReviewSubmitted(reviewId);

// On review update
await QualityTriggers.onReviewUpdated(reviewId);
```

### Component Integration

Add real-time assistance to review forms:

```tsx
import ReviewAssistant from '@/components/reviews/ReviewAssistant';

function ReviewForm({ reviewId, section, currentText, onTextChange }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <textarea 
        value={currentText}
        onChange={(e) => onTextChange(e.target.value)}
      />
      
      <ReviewAssistant
        reviewId={reviewId}
        section={section}
        currentText={currentText}
        onTextChange={onTextChange}
        assistanceLevel="standard"
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Monitoring

### Health Checks

The system provides several health check endpoints:

- `/api/quality/analytics` - Basic system status
- `/api/quality/trigger` - Available system actions
- Job queue status via Redis monitoring

### Logging

Quality system events are logged to:

- `ai_feedback_logs` - All AI interactions
- `quality_analysis_jobs` - Job processing status
- Application logs - System errors and performance

### Metrics

Key metrics to monitor:

- **Analysis Success Rate**: Percentage of successful quality analyses
- **Average Processing Time**: Time to complete quality analysis
- **AI API Usage**: OpenAI API call volume and costs
- **Notification Delivery Rate**: Successfully delivered notifications
- **User Engagement**: Real-time assistance usage rates

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Quality Analysis Fails
```bash
# Check OpenAI API key
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
     https://api.openai.com/v1/models

# Check job queue
redis-cli LLEN quality_jobs
```

#### Real-time Assistance Not Working
```typescript
// Verify reviewer permissions
const { data: review } = await supabase
  .from('reviews')
  .select('reviewer_id')
  .eq('id', reviewId)
  .single();

// Check if reviewer_id matches authenticated user
```

#### Notifications Not Sending
```sql
-- Check notification table
SELECT * FROM notifications 
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Check user notification preferences
SELECT notification_preferences FROM users WHERE id = 'user-id';
```

### Performance Optimization

#### Database Indexes
```sql
-- Add custom indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_quality_reports_created_at 
ON review_quality_reports (created_at DESC);

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_jobs_status_priority 
ON quality_analysis_jobs (status, priority DESC);
```

#### Redis Optimization
```bash
# Monitor Redis memory usage
redis-cli INFO memory

# Configure Redis persistence
redis-cli CONFIG SET save "900 1 300 10 60 10000"
```

## Testing

### Validation Script

Run the comprehensive system validation:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/validate-quality-system.ts
```

### Manual Testing

Test individual components:

```bash
# Test quality analysis
curl -X POST /api/quality/trigger \
  -d '{"action": "analyze_review", "target": "review-id"}'

# Test notification system  
curl -X POST /api/quality/trigger \
  -d '{"action": "test_notification", "params": {"message": "Test"}}'
```

## Security

### Data Privacy
- All AI analysis is performed with anonymized data
- Sensitive review content is not logged in plain text
- User data access follows RLS (Row Level Security) policies

### API Security
- All endpoints require authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Rate limiting on AI-powered endpoints

### Audit Trail
- Complete audit log of all AI interactions
- Review quality changes are tracked
- Administrative actions are logged
